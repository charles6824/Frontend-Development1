For the past few days, i've been working seriously on how to develop the necessary skills for developing a wonderful site from scratch.
I started with HTML and then dived into CSS to help me style my web.Though, my designs are still crude and i'm yet to grab the mastery over web based applications.

and grab the necessary skills.

1. HTML .................................Confirmed
